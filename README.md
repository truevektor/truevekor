**Criminal Procedure • Audio Forensics • Digital Evidence • Data Analysis**  
I use GitHub as a learning laboratory and a platform for transparent, reproducible technical-legal research.

## 👋 About Me

I work across the intersection of:

- criminal procedure and evidence law,
- audio forensics (diarization, transcription, signal analysis),
- digital evidence engineering and chain-of-custody reconstruction,
- technical building assessments (heating systems, thermal audits, documentation).

My repositories document how law, technology, measurement, and methodical reasoning can be integrated into **reproducible workflows**.

GitHub allows me to:

- experiment with tools such as Python, Whisper, pyannote, ffmpeg,
- build full evidence repositories for real cases (e.g., II K 70/24),
- teach others how technical and legal inquiry complement one another.

## 🎓 GitHub Education – How I Use It

Within GitHub Education and the Student Developer Pack, I focus on:

- building **open case studies** for students of law, forensics, and data science,
- creating **step-by-step pipelines** for evidence analysis:
  - audio preprocessing,
  - diarization and transcription,
  - timing consistency checks,
  - comparison between courtroom recordings and official transcripts,
- documenting **research-ready, reproducible workflows**.

My repositories are designed so that anyone can:

1. clone the project,  
2. follow the README instructions,  
3. reproduce the analysis with full transparency.

## 🔍 Current Learning & Research Areas

- advanced diarization and speaker-tracking (pyannote),
- forensic-grade signal analysis (formants, silence segmentation, artifact detection),
- automated procedural reporting (Python → DOCX/PDF pipelines),
- GitHub Actions for:
  - auto-updating statistics,
  - generating forensic summaries,
  - validating data integrity in multi-file repositories.

- audio recordings (M4A/OGG/WAV) + diarization,
- transcript comparison tools,
- chain-of-custody reconstruction,
- educational notebooks explaining the methodology.

**Intended use:** legal tech courses, forensic audio workshops, digital evidence methodology training.

---

### `fonoskopia-tools`
A modular pipeline for:

- audio conversion and resampling (ffmpeg),
- diarization (pyannote),
- Whisper-based transcription,
- formatting transcripts for legal review.

Includes well-commented workflows intended for beginners and advanced students.

---

### `joliot-curie-19a`
A technical repository documenting:

- heating & hot-water system diagnostics,
- 3D measurement workflows (Leica DISTO X6),
- thermal imaging interpretation (FLIR C5),
- building audit methodology.

**Intended use:** building-science labs, civil engineering students, interdisciplinary research combining law & engineering.

---

### `evidence-map` – Visual Evidence Analysis Framework
A systematic approach to mapping, connecting, and analyzing evidence in complex cases:

- evidence relationship modeling (causal, temporal, contextual links),
- visual graph representation of evidence networks,
- automated conflict detection between evidence items,
- timeline reconstruction from fragmented data,
- provenance tracking and metadata correlation,
- export to formats suitable for legal briefs (PDF, Markdown, interactive HTML).

**Methodology includes:**
- entity extraction (persons, locations, times, events),
- cross-reference validation,
- inconsistency highlighting,
- chain-of-custody visualization.

**Intended use:** complex case analysis, prosecutorial planning, defense discovery review, academic case studies in evidence theory.

## 🧭 Assignments / Labs (GitHub Education Compatible)

The following exercises are designed for students, educators, and researchers who want to explore digital forensics, legal-tech analysis, or data-driven methodology.

### **Lab 1 — Audio Evidence Integrity Check**
**Objective:** Reproduce a basic forensic workflow.  
**Tasks:**
1. Clone `fonoskopia-tools`.  
2. Convert the sample audio files using `ffmpeg`.  
3. Run diarization and generate a segment map.  
4. Compare diarization timestamps with the transcript.  
5. Submit a short report explaining discrepancies.

### **Lab 2 — Transcript vs Recording Consistency**
**Objective:** Identify procedural anomalies.  
**Tasks:**
1. Load a provided courtroom audio segment.  
2. Generate a Whisper transcription.  
3. Compare it line-by-line with the “official transcript”.  
4. Highlight mismatches related to:
   - omission,
   - misattribution of speakers,
   - altered sequencing.  
5. Discuss the impact on fair-trial guarantees.

### **Lab 3 — Chain of Custody Reconstruction**
**Objective:** Understand digital evidence lifecycle.  
**Tasks:**
1. Navigate the `IIK_70_24` directory structure.  
2. Review metadata in the `metadane/` folder.  
3. Build a timeline of evidence creation, copying, and storage.  
4. Identify any “breaks” in the chain.  
5. Submit a formal structured report.

### **Lab 4 — Technical Building Audit (Interdisciplinary)**
**Objective:** Apply engineering measurement workflow.  
**Tasks:**
1. Review photographic and thermographic documentation in `joliot-curie-19a`.  
2. Analyze heat-loss indicators and insulation patterns.  
3. Correlate sensor readings with structural documentation.  
4. Produce a short engineering-legal assessment.

### **Lab 5 — Automated Reporting with GitHub Actions**
**Objective:** Learn reproducible research using CI.

4. Publish results to the repository’s README.

### **Lab 6 — Evidence Mapping and Relationship Analysis**
**Objective:** Build and analyze an evidence map for a multi-source case.  
**Tasks:**
1. Clone the `evidence-map` repository.  
2. Load sample evidence items (documents, audio, metadata, timestamps).  
3. Define relationships between evidence pieces:
   - temporal (before/after/simultaneous),
   - causal (leads to, contradicts, supports),
   - referential (mentions, describes, documents).  
4. Generate a visual graph representation of the evidence network.  
5. Identify inconsistencies or gaps in the evidence chain.  
6. Export the map as a structured report for legal review.
